### Hello World 👋

My name is Aline Bastos, and I am from Brazil 🇧🇷. 

I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2001 unofficially, and since 2010 officially. 

I have worked with a lot of different projects and companies, and I love to contribute to the community and mentoring people.

Now I have a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DeFrontcomAline) to show how to initiate in the Front-End development world, how to contribute with open source and communities, and I am starting there a Front-End course focused on Accessibility, Usability, Performance, Best Practices, and SEO.

More about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently looking for work as Front-End Software Developer | React | Node | Team Lead
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, React Native, Node, MongoDB, Software Architecture, Agile Methodologies, and E2E/Unit tests, besides my beloved JavaScript and CSS, that I will always be learning 💚
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I almost ended up working as a flight attendant in 2001, before getting to know the web development world.
